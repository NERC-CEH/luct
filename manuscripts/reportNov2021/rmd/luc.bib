This allows us to evaluate the variability of an indicator and to assess the importance of an observed difference between two performance indicators. We will assume that the values in a confusion matrix are observations coming from a multinomial distribution. Our method is based on a Bayesian approach in which the unknown parameters of the multinomial probability function themselves are assumed to be generated from a random vector. We will show that these unknown parameters follow a Dirichlet distribution. Thanks to the Bayesian approach, we also benefit from an elegant way of injecting prior knowledge into the distributions. Experiments are done on real and synthetic data sets and assess our method’s ability to construct accurate distributions.},

The countryside is sampled and studied using rigorous scientific methods, allowing results to be compared with those from previous surveys. In this way the quantity and quality of change in our landscapes can be recorded and even the most gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK’s countryside over time can be detected. This evidence is used to help form policies that influence management of the countryside, both now and in the future. The Survey is a very detailed study of a sample of 1km squares, located all over England, Scotland and Wales. Individual squares are chosen so that they represent all major habitat types in the UK And enough of each type are selected to ensure that the statistical analysis for that habitat is robust and reliable. The location of study squares is kept confidential to avoid any deliberate influences that could affect them or the features within them. In this way the sample squares will remain a true reflection of changes in the wider countryside and they will continue to provide a reliable comparison for future Surveys. Within each 1km square, teams of trained field surveyors record a range of information including: * Broad and Priority habitats * Linear and point features * Vegetation plots of different types (29 per square on average) * Measurements and samples from streams and ponds * Soil samples},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 816–827 Abstract Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

The approach provides a general framework for combining multiple disparate data sources with a simple model. This allows us to constrain estimates of gross land-use change with reliable national-scale census data, whilst retaining the detailed information available from several other sources. Eight different data sources, with three different data structures, were combined in our posterior estimate of land use and land-use change, and other data sources could easily be added in future. The tendency for observations to underestimate gross land-use change is accounted for by allowing for a skewed distribution in the likelihood function. The data structure produced has high temporal and spatial resolution, and is appropriate for dynamic process-based modelling. Uncertainty is propagated appropriately into the output, so we have a full posterior distribution of output and parameters. The data are available in the widely used netCDF file format from http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Quantifying the net carbon flux from land use and land cover changes (\emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC}) is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle, and hence, to support climate change mitigation. However, large-scale \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} is not directly measurable, but has to be inferred from models instead, such as semi-empirical bookkeeping models, and process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). By definition, \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} estimates are not directly comparable between these two different model types. As an example, DGVM-based \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} in the annual global carbon budgets is estimated under transient environmental forcing and includes the so-called Loss of Additional Sink Capacity (LASC). The LASC accounts for the impact of environmental changes on land carbon storage potential of managed land compared to potential vegetation which is not represented in bookkeeping models. In addition, \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} from transient DGVM simulations differs depending on the arbitrary chosen simulation time period and the historical timing of land use and land cover changes (including different accumulation periods for legacy effects). An approximation of \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} by DGVMs that is independent of the timing of land use and land cover changes and their legacy effects requires simulations assuming constant pre-industrial or present-day environmental forcings. Here, we analyze three DGVM-derived \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} estimations for twelve models within 18 regions and quantify their differences as well as climate- and CO\textsubscript{2}-induced components. The three estimations stem from the commonly performed simulation with transiently changing environmental conditions and two simulations that keep environmental conditions fixed, at pre-industrial and present-day conditions. Averaged across the models, we find a global \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} (under transient conditions) of 2.0\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.6\&thinsp;PgC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} for 2009\&ndash;2018, of which ∼40\&thinsp;\% are attributable to the LASC (0.8\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.3\&thinsp;PgC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}). From 1850 onward, \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} accumulated to 189\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;56\&thinsp;PgC with 40\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;15\&thinsp;PgC from the LASC. Regional hotspots of high cumulative and annual LASC values are found in the USA, China, Brazil, Equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia, mainly due to deforestation for cropland. Distinct negative LASC estimates, in Europe (early reforestation) and from 2000 onward in the Ukraine (recultivation of post-Soviet abandoned agricultural land), indicate that \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} estimates in these regions are lower in transient DGVM- compared to bookkeeping-approaches. By unraveling spatio-temporal variability in three alternative DGVM-derived \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} estimates, our results call for a harmonized attribution of model-derived \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC}. We propose an approach that bridges bookkeeping and DGVM approaches for \emph{f}\textsubscript{LULCC} estimation by adopting a mean DGVM-ensemble LASC for a defined reference period.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This approach extends the practical applicability of DE-MC and is shown to be about 5–26 times more efficient than the optimal Normal random walk Metropolis sampler for the 97.5\% point of a variable from a 25–50 dimensional Student t3 distribution.

Geostatistical simulation is widely used in error modeling, as it can generate equal-probable realizations of the fields being considered, which can be summarized to facilitate error propagation analysis. To fix noninvariance in indicator simulation, discriminant space-based methods were proposed to enhance consistency in area-class mapping and replicability in uncertainty modeling, as the former is achieved by imposing means while the latter is ensured by projecting spatio-temporal correlated residuals in discriminant space to geographic space through a mapping process. This paper explores discriminant models for error propagation in land cover change detection, followed by experiments based on bi-temporal remote sensing images. It was found that misclassification error propagation is effectively characterized with discriminant covariate-based stochastic simulation, where spatio-temporal interdependence is taken into account.},
