The figures below show the results of the data assimilation procedure. All the data sets shown were used in the algorithm, but their relative random uncertainties ($\sigma$) determined how much influence they have on the estimates. The spatial data sets were corrected for systematic uncertainties, using the estimated net false positive rate ($F_P$). Having estimated the posterior distribution of the $\beta$ matrix, we used this to simulate multiple maps of land use going back in time to 1950. The maps of the likelihood of transition to each land use established in WP-A were updated dynamically, using the life tables described in Section 5.

<img src="Results_ni_files/figure-html/plotB-1.png" alt=" Observations and posterior distribution of the transition matrix $\mathbf{B}$, representing the gross area changing from the land use in each row to the land use in each column each year from 1950 to 2020. The grey shaded band shows the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the posterior distribution. The maximum *a posteriori* estimate is shown as the solid black line within this. Observations from the different data sources are shown as coloured circles. The coloured solid lines show the corrected observations after accounting for systematic uncertainties, and interpolating. The coloured bands around these lines show the random uncertainty, rescaled as $\sigma /5$ to keep with the axis scale. Because the random uncertainties and the corrections to the observations are generally very large in comparison to the actual change, scaling the axes is difficult. Note that a consistent colour scheme for the data sources is shown, but not all contribute to every figure." width="130%" />
